Each class and what it contains/entails
---------------------------------------

pattern
    - contains a line object
    - contains an interpreter object
    - contains action object

line 
    - contains the unformatted user input (std::string)
    - contains the root of the AST (Node*)

interpreter
    - takes in a string and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree

action 
    - executes user input by traversing the AST generatred by interpreter

node 
    - structural representation of the user input
    
object
    - defines compositional hierarchy for the interpreter
    

------------------------------------------

pattern is created, line is given user input string
pattern uses its interpreter on line->string , generates AST in line object
pattern uses its action object on the line->AST , executes the tree
